Should say who created board

User page, link board creator, votes, comments to page that lists all user's other comments and boards.



need to rebind the scoreboard when user logs in... Should preserve value of text boxes.


New Features:
*  Add an "update me when Scorebored changes" option when you create a board.
*  Better to store URLs with _ where spaces exist!
*  Might have to make it invite only (send message to owner
*  board owner should have delete privileges for scores/comments
*	vertical centering of scores is done through nested divs for IE.  this is bad SEO.  
	there are solutions to vertically center in JavaSCript as well as dynamically change text height to fill cell.
